# Dotfiles

This repository hosts a collection of configuration files and shell scripts
tailored to my specific needs. I intend to make it work seamlessly under both
Linux and macOS, though the priority is to aid my workflow on a workstation
running Arch Linux and Wayland. There will also be a bootstrap solution for
handling symlinks later down the road.
